# Nova
My own effort to create stack-based (& compiled) language.  Simply an excuse to learn more about how languages work!

IT IS heavily inspired by Porth (tsoding)! 

## How to use
You can either simulate the code OR compile to an executable (output).  The executable is written in Assembly.  The simulation is done using python3.
``` sh
./nova.py --simulate <file>
./nova.py --compile <file>
./output
```
