# Nova
My own effort to create stack-based (& compiled) language.  Simply an excuse to learn more about how languages work!

IT IS heavily inspired by Porth (tsoding)! 

## How to use
You can either simulate the code OR compile to an executable (output).  The executable is written in Assembly.  The simulation is done using python3.
``` sh
./nova.py --help
./nova.py --simulate (-s) <file>
./nova.py --compile  (-c) <file>
build/output
```

## TODO
 - Improve Lexer to enable better debugging (ie. showing where error is occurring)
